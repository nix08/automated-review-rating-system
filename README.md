The Automated Review Rating System is a Python-based application designed to analyze user-generated reviews and predict corresponding ratings using natural language processing and machine learning techniques. It streamlines the feedback analysis process for platforms such as e-commerce websites, hospitality services, or educational portals.

### 🎯 Example Use Case

Imagine a hotel receives hundreds of guest reviews daily. Manually reading and scoring each one is time-consuming and inconsistent. With this system:

- Textual reviews like “The rooms were spotless and staff was friendly” are automatically interpreted using sentiment analysis.
- The system predicts a 4.5-star rating based on language tone and keyword intensity.
- Review summaries and rating predictions are visualized for the management team to improve service.

This helps businesses uncover hidden insights, maintain consistent feedback metrics, and improve customer experience based on real-time review data.
